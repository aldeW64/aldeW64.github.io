This project looked into the lifelong policy adaptation situation. The idea behind was that attention should be paid to leveraging real-world data to fine-tune the policy continuously. The work proposed a pipeline to loop simulated training and real-world data collection, with only a limited amount of data to yield eminent performance in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments. 
<!-- We propose a lifelong policy adaptation framework named LoopSR, which utilizes a transformerbased encoder to project real-world trajectories into a latent space, and accordingly reconstruct the real-world environments back in simulation for further improvement. By leveraging the continual training, LoopSR achieves superior data efficiency compared with strong baselines, with only a limited amount of data to yield eminent performance in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments. -->
